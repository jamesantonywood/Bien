# NOTES

## Rails

Rails is built on convention: There is a way to think about certain things

---

## MVC

- Stands for Model View Controller

### Model

- In the database
- Similar to post-type

### View

- HTML Content that changes

### Controller

- Sits inbetween the Model and the View
- Take the URL and find the right db Model and the right view to inject the data into

---

## Generating a Controller

```bash
~rails generate controller reviews
```

This generates-

- app/controllers/reviews_controller.rb
- app/views/reviews
- app/controllers/reviews_controller_test.rb
- app/helpers/reviews_helper.rb
- app/assets/javascripts/reviews.coffee
- app/assets/stylesheets/reviews.scss

---

### Routes

[Rails Routing Guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html)

in: _'config/routes.rb'_

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # Code Here
end
```

Adding a resource (rails convention).

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :reviews
  root "reviews#index"
end
```

_returns_ The action 'index' could not be found for ReviewsController message in browser.

This is because there is no index method on the reviews controller.

controller#methodName

---

### Setting up the page

Currently the controller isnt doing anything.

in: _'app/controllers/reviews_controller.rb'_

This is a Class that inherites Rails' ApplicationController Class

```ruby
class ReviewsController < ApplicationController

  def index
    # This function handles the 'list' page of reviews
  end

end
```

Right now the Controller is set up to handle the index but it has no View or Model to use

---

## Creating the View

in: _'app/views'_

we have

- '/layouts'
- '/reviews'

in: _'app/views/reviews'_

add: _'index.html.erb'_

The _.erb_ extention to the HTML is an 'embedded ruby file.' It will let us embed ruby into our 'template'

Now our controller is automatically looking in: _'app/views/reviws'_ (looking for a views folder that shares the same name) and running the template â€”- in this case it is index.html.erb

! I DON'T KNOW AT THE MINUTE IF IT WILL ALWAYS RUN AN INDEX OR IF IT IS LOOKING FOR THE METHOD NAME

- Route (Looks for controller and method)
- Controller (Outlines Methods)
- View (Renders the request)

---

## Adding Variables to Views

The idea of Ruby is to dynamically change webpages

### Example Generate Random Number

in: _'app/controllers/reviews_controller.rb'_
in: _'index method'_

Creating a variable

```ruby
@number = rand(100)
```

And we can use it
in: _'app/views/reviews/index.html.erb'_

```html
<p>The Random Number is <%= @number %></p>
```

---

## Looping in Views

in: _'app/controllers/reviews_controller.rb'_

```ruby
@reviews = [
  "The Smile",
  "Baby Bo's",
  "Chipotle"
]
```

in: _'app/views/reviews/index.html.erb'_

```html
<!-- loop over @reviews -->
<% @reviews.each do |review| %>

<div class="review"><%= review %></div>

<% end %>
```

---

## The application HTML

in: _'app/views/layouts/application.html.erb'_

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Bien</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" />
    <%= csrf_meta_tags %> <%= csp_meta_tag %> <%= stylesheet_link_tag
    'application', media: 'all', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %> <%=
    javascript_pack_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %>
  </head>

  <body>
    <header></header>
    <!-- Print Page Specific Content  -->
    <%= yield %>
    <!-- / -->
    <footer></footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

This is a wrapper for a basic html page - saves having all of the HTML gunk on a given page.

This is also the start of thinking with _partials_

---

## The link-to Helper

in: _'app/views/layouts/application.html.erb'_

```html
<!--Adding a new review link-->
<!-- This is a routing error because rails doesnt know what newreview.html is -->
<a href="/newreview.html">Add a review</a>

<!-- Using Rails' link_to helper -->
<nav>
  <%= link_to "home", root_path %> <%= link_yo "Add a new review",
  new_review_path %>
</nav>
```

adding a #new method to the review controller

in: _'app/controllers/reviews_controller.rb'_

```ruby
# Add a new method to the controller
def new
  # Handle new page
end
```

in: _'app/views/reviews'_

add: _'new.html.erb'_

```html
<h3>Add Your New Restaurant Review</h3>
```

in here we might have a form that would submit to the db

---

### Checking Routes

Checking the routes available to our rails application can give us an idea of how to handle certain actions.

Exit out of the server

```bash
~ rails routes
```

```text

  Prefix Verb       |   URI Pattern                   |   Controller#Action
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  reviews GET       |   /reviews(.:format)            |   reviews#index
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  POST              |   /reviews(.:format)            |   reviews#create
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  new_review GET    |   /reviews/new(.:format)        |   reviews#new
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  edit_review GET   |   /reviews/:id/edit(.:format)   |   reviews#edit
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  review GET        |   /reviews/:id(.:format)        |   reviews#show
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  PATCH             |   /reviews/:id(.:format)        |   reviews#update
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  PUT               |   /reviews/:id(.:format)        |   reviews#update
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  DELETE            |   /reviews/:id(.:format)        |   reviews#destroy
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  root GET          |   /                             |   reviews#index
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```

---

## The M in MVC. The Model

A basic DB table w/ some placeholder rows. Each row corresponds to an individual review.

```text

  Title          |   Body          |   Score   |   User       |   Price   |   cuisine
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Review Title   |   Review Body   |   9/10    |   username   |    $$     |   italian
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Review Title   |   Review Body   |   9/10    |   username   |    $$     |   italian
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Review Title   |   Review Body   |   9/10    |   username   |    $$     |   italian
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```

### Generating the model

Statring with a simple model for our reviews

exit server

```bash
~rails generate model Review title:string body:text score:integer restaurant:string price:integer cuisine:string
```

This sets up our simple model with some fields

This generates-

- db/migrate/20220213205902_create_reviews.rb
- app/models/review.rb
- test/models/review_test.rb
- test/fixtures/reviews.yml

_'db/migrate/20220213205902_create_reviews.rb'_ is a file that tells the database to create a new table.

```ruby
class CreateReviews < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]
  def change
    create_table :reviews do |t|
      t.string :title
      t.text :body
      t.integer :score
      t.string :restaurant
      t.integer :price
      t.string :cuisine

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

There is a difference between our code and the database itself

- The code will run actions and grab data from the database
- The database unsuprisingly stores data

Right now we have created the 'code' but we haven't told our database to update.

Rails comes with sqlite

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

updates the database, runs the migration and any that hasnt been ran yet.

! Its important to check the migration file 'code' for typos and mistakes

When we go online the database will be different
local DB gives us a chance to test data

---

### Adding a form

in: _'app/controllers/reviews_controller.rb'_

Create access to new entry in the model.

```ruby
def new
  @review = Review.new
end
```

in: _'app/views/new.html.erb'_

```html
<%= form_for @review do |f| %>

<p><%= f.label :title %> <%= f.text_field :title %></p>

<p><%= f.label :body %> <%= f.text_area :body %></p>

<p><%= f.label :score %> <%= f.number_field :score %></p>

<%= f.submit "Save Review" %>
```

find out more by googling _rails input helpers_

---

### Creating and saving the review

The form needs to call the #create action
This will create a new row in the database

in: _'app/controllers/reviews_controller.rb'_

```ruby
def create
  # take info from form and add to database
  @review = Review.new(params.require(:review).permit(:title, :body, :score))

  # save this to the database
  @review.save

  # redirect back to the homepage
  redirect_to root_path

end
```

update index method to have reviews pulled from database

```ruby
 def index
    # This function handles the 'list' page of reviews
    @reviews = Review.all

end

```

_returns_ an array of '#<Review:0x00007fea2ab86ac0>'

access the data from the model in HTML view

in: _'app/views/reviews/index.html.erb'_

```html
<div class="review"><%= link_to review.title, review_path(review) %></div>
```

---

### Adding a show page

This is for the inner review page
We need to add a show method

in: _'app/controllers/reviews_controller.rb'_

```ruby
def show
  # the individual review page
  @review = Review.find(params[:id])
end
```

add: -'app/views/reviews/show.html.erb'-

in: _'app/views/reviews/show.html.erb'_

```html
<h1><%= @review.title %></h1>
<p><%= @review.score %> / 10</p>

<div><%= @review.body %></div>
```

---

### A Simple format helper

This works like a simple version of wp_auto_p

in: _'app/views/reviews/show.html.erb'_

```html
<h1><%= @review.title %></h1>
<p><%= @review.score %></p>

<div><%= simple_format @review.body %></div>
```

---

## Deleting Reviews

uses the #destroy method

```text

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  DELETE            |   /reviews/:id(.:format)        |   reviews#destroy
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```

in: _'app/views/reviews/show.html.erb'_

```html
<div class="actions">
  <%= link_to "Delete Review", review_path, method: :delete %>
</div>
```

in: _'app/controllers/reviews_controller.rb'_

```ruby
def destroy
  # find the individual review
  @review = Review.find(params[:id])
  # destroy it
  @review.destroy
  # redirect to homepage
  redirect_to root_path
end
```

Add a confirmation

in: _'app/views/reviews/show.html.erb'_

```html
<%= link_to "Delete Review", review_path, method: :delete, data: {confirm: "Are
you sure?"} %>
```

---

## Editing Reviews

Add an edit link on the page

needs the edit and update routes

```text
  
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  edit_review GET   |   /reviews/:id/edit(.:format)   |   reviews#edit
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  PUT               |   /reviews/:id(.:format)        |   reviews#update
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```

in actions div in: _'app/views/reviews/show.html.erb'_

We want to add the edit link

```html
<%= link_to "Edit this Review", edit_review_path(@review) %>
```

then in the controller in: _'app/controllers/reviews_controller.rb'_

```ruby
def edit
  # find the review to edit
  @review = Review.find(params[:id])
end
```

then we need an edit view

add: _'app/views/reviews/edit.html.erb'_

in this file

```html
<h3>Edit your Restaurant Review</h3>

<%= form_for @review do |f| %>

<p><%= f.label :title %> <%= f.text_field :title %></p>

<p><%= f.label :body %> <%= f.text_area :body %></p>

<p><%= f.label :score %> <%= f.number_field :score %></p>

<%= f.submit "Save your edit"%> <% end %>
```

Then update

in: _'app/controllers/reviews_controller.rb'_

```ruby
def update
  # find review
  @review = Review.find(params[:id])
  # update with new info
  @review.update(params.require(:review).permit(:title, :body, :score))
  # redirect to somewhere new
  redirect_to review_path
end
```

---

## Cleaning code

in: _'app/controllers/reviews_controller.rb'_

```ruby
def form_params
  params.require(:review).permit(:title, :body, :score)
end

# then in update and create...
# @review.update(form_params)
# saves repetition

```

---

### Making use of partials

for the form...

add: _'_form.html.erb'_

the _ file prefix tells rails it is a partial

```html
<%= form_for @review do |f| %>

<p><%= f.label :title %> <%= f.text_field :title %></p>

<p><%= f.label :body %> <%= f.text_area :body %></p>

<p><%= f.label :score %> <%= f.number_field :score %></p>

<%= f.submit "Save your edit"%> <% end %>
```

then in HTML files

```html
<%= render "form" %>
```

---

## Images and Stylesheets

these are located in: _'app/assets/'_

add: _'global.scss'_ to _'app/assets/stylesheets/'_

here I can structure SASS however I want

!! It would be interesting to see how POSTCSS and other preprocessors would be added to a project

adding an image

```html
<%= image_tag "bien-logo.svg" %>

<!-- Wrapping tags... -->
<h1>
  <%= link_to root_path do %> <%= image_tag "bien-reviews.svg" %> <% end %>
</h1>
```

---

## Ruby Syntax

```ruby

  # How variables work

  ## Numbers
  @number = 13
  @number = 14
  # number === 14

  ## Strings
  @username = "jameswood" + "admin"

  ## Symbols
  # We cant ever change a symbol
  @method = :delete

  ## Arrays
  @shopping_list = ["eggs", "bacon", "sausages"]

  ## Hashes - similar to objects
  @person = { 
    first_name: "James", 
    age: 26, 
    shopping: ["eggs"] 
  }

  ## Hash with a key as a symbol
  @link = { method: :delete }


```

# Week 2

## Checking data with model validations

Data lives with the models and are the gateholders

[Active Record Validations](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html)

Active record is what ruby uses to check and look after data.

in _'app/models/review.rb'_

generated

```ruby
class Review < ApplicationRecord
end
```

```ruby
class Review < ApplicationRecord
  validates :title, presence: true
  validates :body, length: { minimum: 10 }
  validates :score, numericality: { only_integer: true, greater_than_or_equal_to: 0, less_than_or_equal_to: 10 }
end
```
validates model input to see if is allowed to save, currently redirects to post if invalid without updating

conditional redirect if invalid goto edit view with error messages
else goto post with edits completed

---

## Reopening project

ALWAYS start with a git pull
Then run server and take a look at the site
Then start working in a Text Editor

---

## Fixing controllers for validations

in: _'app/controllers/reviews_controller.rb'_

```ruby
   
  def create
      # take info from form and add to model
      @review = Review.new(form_params)
      # if the model passes validation
      if @review.save
          # redirect to the homepage
          redirect_to root_path
      else
          #otherwise show the new view
          render "new"
      end
  end

```

Also need this in update action

```ruby

  # update the edited review in the database
  def update 
      # find review
      @review = Review.find(params[:id])
      # update with new info
      if @review.update(form_params)
          # redirect to somewhere new
          redirect_to review_path(@review)
      else 
          render "edit"
      end
  end

```

---

## Using to_param to make SEO-friendly URLs

Currently the reviews have a slug that is akin to the following

root/reviews/5

and for SEO and legibility it would be better to have

root/reviews/review-title

in _'app/models/review.rb'_

default slug is

```ruby

  #default deep within rails
  def to_param
    id.to_s
  end  

  # overwrite in the model
  def to_param
    id.to_s + "-" + title
  end  

  #produces: 5-Hello%20World

  #url friensly form

  def to_param
    id.to_s + "-" + title.parameterize
  end  
  #produces: 4-hello-world

```

## Adding page titles with content_for

in the application wrapper html 

_'app/views/layouts/application.html.erb'_

```html
  
  <title><%= content_for :page_title  %> - Bien Revies â€“ Bien reviews the best restaurants in the world</title>

```

:page_title is a symbol because its never going to change across the site

Then in our reviews views (show, new, index, edit)

```html
  
  <!-- What is the symbol?, what is its value -->
  <!-- Show Page -->
  <% content_for :page_title, @review.title %>

  <!-- New Page -->
  <% content_for :page_title, "Add a new review" %>

```

## Uncovering field in the Database

The model is not the database

The model is a tool for interacting and controlling the database

in: _'db/migrate'_

there are a number of files called migrations

migrations are files that tell rails what to do with the database

currently there is one migration that tells the database to: 

- Create a table called reviews
- Add the fields detailed in the migration with their data-type

in: '/db/'

there is also a 'schema.rb' file

This is a final version of what the database looks like

---

To add a new field to our reviews that already exists in the database
in this case the 'retaurant' field

we have to update the M, V and C

we update the model to validate the input
we update the views to display the field (in new, edit or a form partial for both of these) and to render the data (show)
we update the controller that says what is being submitted, in this case it is in our custom form_params method:

```ruby

  def form_params
     # what can be submitted to the model and then in turn the database?
        params.require(:review).permit(:title, :body, :score, :restaurant)
    end


```


## Adding new database fields with migrations

If a client wants extra fields for their reviews that we dont have in our database

we do this with migrations

eg. phone number, ambience

we want to make two new columns in the database

in terminal

```bash

~ Rails generate migration add_new_info_to_reviews 

```

[info on migrations](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html)

in the newly generated migration file 

```ruby

  class AddNewInfoToReviews < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]
    def change

      add_column :reviews, :phone_number, :string
      add_column :reviews, :ambience, :string

    end
  end

```
Make sure migration file is checked and double-checked as its harder to rollback


back in terminal
run the migrations

```bash

~ Rails db:migrate

```

then check 'schema.rb' to see the new columns/updates

we can then use these new fields in the application

if a field is to be optional we dont need to validate it in the model, we can however continue to use it in the views as we have been
(remember to update the controller to allow the new data to be submitted)

```html
<% if @review.ambience.present? %>
  <div class="ambience">
      <p><%= @review.ambience %></p> 
  </div>
<% end %>
```

## Filtering our params

A user should be able to search by location and filter by price and cuisine

in index action of controller and index.html.erb


### using the query string...

if there is a filter return those reviews that match otherwise return all reviews

```ruby

  def index
    @price = params[:price]

    if @price.present?
      #filter by price
      ...?
    else
      # all reviews
      Reviews.all
    end

  end

```

## Filtering with our reviews controller

```ruby

  def index
    # query sting params are saved in params with symbols {:price : value}
    @price = params[:price]

    if @price.present?
      #filter by price
      @reviews = Review.where(price: @price)
    else
      # all reviews
      @reviews = Review.all
    end

  end

```

```html

  <nav class="filters">
    <%= link_to "All Prices", root_path %>
    <%= link_to "$", root_path(price: 1) %>
    <%= link_to "$$", root_path(price: 2) %>
    <%= link_to "$$$", root_path(price: 3) %>
  </nav>

```


## Adding multiple filters in one controller action

filter multiple params
```ruby

  def index

    @price = params[:price]
    @cuisine = params[:cuisine]

    #start with all reviews
    @reviews = Review.all

    #filtering by price
    if @price.present?
      @reviews = @reviews.where(price: @price)
    end

    #filter by cuisine
    if @cuisine.present?
      @reviews = @reviews.where(cuisine: @cusine)
    end

  end

```


update links to include both params so both can be included in the filter, not needed if one filter at a time is required

```html

  <nav class="filters">
      <%= link_to "All Prices", root_path %>
      <%= link_to "$", root_path(price: 1, cuisine: @cuisine) %>
      <%= link_to "$$", root_path(price: 2, cuisine: @cuisine) %>
      <%= link_to "$$$", root_path(price: 3, cuisine: @cuisine) %>

      <%= link_to "Indian", root_path(cuisine: "Indian", price: @price) %>
  </nav>

```

## Adding geolocation using the geocoder gem

[Awesome ruby gems](https://github.com/markets/awesome-ruby)

[Geocoder](https://github.com/alexreisner/geocoder)

Gems are libraries for specific tasks

Rails is like one big gem

```bash

  ~gem install geocoder

```

or in the gemfile

```ruby

  gem 'geocoder'

```

and run in bash

```bash

  ~bundle install

```

Geocoder wants latitude and longitude columns in the database to work with so we need to add this to the reviews with a migration...


```bash
~rails generate migration add_location_to_reviews
```

then in the newly generated migration db/migrate

```ruby
class AddLocationToReviews < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]
  def change

    add_column :reviews, :address, :text
    add_column :reviews, :latitude, :float
    add_column :reviews, :longitude, :float

  end
end

```

in review model, app/models/review.rb

```ruby
class Review < ApplicationRecord
    # Geocoder
    geocoded_by :address
    after_validation :geocode

    # Check model input
    validates :title, presence: true
    validates :body, length: { minimum: 10 }
    validates :score, numericality: { only_integer: true, greater_than_or_equal_to: 0, less_than_or_equal_to: 10 }
    validates :restaurant, presence: true
    validates :address, presence: true

    def to_param
        id.to_s + "-" + title.parameterize
    end  

end
```

M is done, now we need V: form, show, etc.

```html
<p>
  <%= f.label :restaurant %>
  <%= f.text_field :restaurant %>
</p>
```

Now for C controller for geocoder

```ruby
  
  def form_params
      params.require(:review).permit(:title, :address, :restaurant, :body, :score, :ambience, :price, :cuisine)
  end

```

! Addresses have to be spelled correctly... 

## Filtering by location

in controller#index

```ruby
  
  #filter near Location
  if @location.present?
      # return all reviews that are in a 1 mile radius of the search term
      @reviews = @reviews.near(@location, 1)
  end

```

## Adding a search location form

in index.erb.html

```html

  <form action="/">
      <input type="text" name="location" placeholder="search location..." value="<%= @location %>">
      <input type="hidden" name="price" value="<%= @price %>">
      <input type="hidden" name="cuisine" value="<%= @cuisine %>">
  </form>

```


## Making our forms simple using simple_form

[simple form github](https://github.com/heartcombo/simple_form)

add simple form to the gemfile and install the bundle.

then we can install simple form into the application by

```bash
  
  $ rails generate simple_form:install

  # outputs
  create  config/initializers/simple_form.rb
  exist  config/locales
  create  config/locales/simple_form.en.yml
  create  lib/templates/erb/scaffold/_form.html.erb

```

simple form reduces the amount of code needed for the input form

in _'_form.html.erb'_ partial we can replace the verbose markup with 

```html

  <%= simple_form_for @review do |f|%>
    <%= f.input :title %>
    <%= f.input :restaurant %>
    <%= f.input :address %>
    <%= f.input :body %>
    <%= f.input :cuisine %>
    <%= f.input :price %>
    <%= f.input :score %>
    <%= f.input :ambience %>

    <%= f.button :submit %>
  <% end %>

``` 

This will also give us extra handy tools such as marking required fields, displaying errors next to input's with errors and giving error classes to inputs for styling.

## Highlighting our links with active_link_to

[active_link_to gem](https://github.com/comfy/active_link_to)

```html

  <%= active_link_to "All Restaurants", root_path, active: { price: nil, cuisine: nil, location: nil } %>
  <div>
    <%= active_link_to "$", root_path(price: 1, cuisine: @cuisine, location: @location), active: { price: 1 } %>
    <%= active_link_to "$$", root_path(price: 2, cuisine: @cuisine, location: @location), active: { price: 2 } %>
    <%= active_link_to "$$$", root_path(price: 3, cuisine: @cuisine, location: @location), active: { price: 3 }  %>
  </div>
  <div>
    <%= active_link_to "Indian", root_path(cuisine: "Indian", price: @price), active: { cuisine: "Indian" }  %>
  </div>

```


# Introducing Comments

Any data-type needs an MVC structure. If this site was to list job positions this would be a new MVC Model(Job), Views(index, show, new, edit), Controller(jobs_controller).
Data types stand alone but we can make them talk to each other with a 'relationship'

For instance Reviews might have Comments, this would be a 'one-to-many' relationship

Relationships can be 

- one-to-one
- one-to-many
- many-to-many

## One-to-many Relationships

Comments are their own data-type or another table in the database

one Review can have many comments but a comment cant have many reviews.

This is what makes it a one-to-many relationship

An illustration of a comments table

```text

  User       |   Body                 |   Review ID   |
  -----------------------------------------------------
  -----------------------------------------------------
  James      |   Expensive! :o        |   4           |
  -----------------------------------------------------
  Chloe      |   So Nice!             |   4           |
  -----------------------------------------------------
  Charlie    |   Meow!                |   1           |
  -----------------------------------------------------
  -----------------------------------------------------

```

## Adding the comments model

```bash
rails generate model Comment body:text review:belongs_to

# Check generated migration to see if the information is correct then...
rails db:migrate

# Make the database in sync

```

in review.rb model

```ruby

  # add an association that has a 1-to-many relationship
  has_many :comments

```

in comment.rb model

```ruby
class Comment < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :review

  validates :body, presence: true

end
```

Now the groundwork is laid for the two data-types to work together but it wont work just yet.

Still need a UI for users to leave comments
and the controller actions to save and display comments


## creating the comments controller

For now - until we have an admin system - users can only add comments not edit and update

```bash

  rails generate controller comments

```

### set up routes

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :reviews do 
    resources :comments
  end

  root "reviews#index"
end
```

having the comments resource in a do-end after reviews ties the comments to the reviews

in reviews show page

```

<!-- Adding the 'add comment' form -->

<h3>Add a comment</h3>

<%= simple_form_for [@review, Comment.new] do |f| %>
    <%= f.input :body, label: "Type your comment here" %>
    <%= f.button :submit, "Comment" %>
<% end %>

```

and in the comments controller

```ruby

class CommentsController < ApplicationController

    def create
        # What review did we leave a comment on?
        # We get the review id because we nested comments in the routes file
        @review = Review.find(params[:review_id])

        # the new comment is to be added to the comments field in the reviews db table
        @comment = @review.comments.new(params.require(:comment).permit(:body))

        # save the comment
        @comment.save

        # go back to the review page
        redirect_to review_path(@review)
    end

end

```

### showing the comments

in reviews show page

```html
<h3>Comments</h3>

<% @review.comments.each do |comment| %>
    <div class="comment">
        <%= simple_format comment.body %>
        <p>Posted at: <%= comment.created_at %></p>
    </div>
<% end %>
```

[rails date helpera](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v6.1.4/classes/ActionView/Helpers/DateHelper.html)

updated show

```html
<h3>Comments</h3>

<% @review.comments.order_by('created_at desc').each do |comment| %>
    <div class="comment">
        <%= simple_format comment.body %>
        <p>Posted at: <%= time_ago_in_words comment.created_at %> ago</p>
    </div>
<% end %>
```

## showing comments count on reviews index

[Rails pluralize](https://apidock.com/rails/ActionView/Helpers/TextHelper/pluralize)

```html

<% @reviews.each do |review| %>

  <div class="review">
      <%= link_to review_path(review) do %>
          <h2><%= review.title %></h2>
          <p>
              <%= review.cuisine %> - 
              <%= pluralize review.comments.count, "comment" %>
          </p>

      <% end %>
  </div>

<% end %>

```

# Going live with Heroku

follow heroku docs to set up the CLI 

run heroku login

in gemfile

```ruby
#update database to pg for production only

group development do
  # Use sqlite3 as the database for Active Record
  gem 'sqlite3', '~> 1.4'
end

group production do
  gem 'pg'
end
```

solved bundle install issue when deploying to heroku
```text
I have same issue: remote: ! Failed to install gems via Bundler.

if you see the problem is this:

remote:  Your bundle only supports platforms ["x86_64-darwin-16"] but your local platform
remote:  is x86_64-linux. Add the current platform to the lockfile with `bundle  loc
remote:  --add-platform x86_64-linux` and try again.
its mean this :

Your bundle only supports platforms ["x86_64-darwin-16"] but your local platform is x86_64-linux. Add the current platform to the lockfile with `bundle loc --add-platform x86_64-linux` and try again.
If you see in your gemfile.loc you only have this :

PLATFORMS
  x86_64-darwin-16
So I did this command, To add in your platform in gemfile.loc

bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux
This will update your Gemfile.loc :

PLATFORMS
  x86_64-darwin-16
  x86_64-linux
Continue :

git add .
git commit -m "add platform x86_64-linux"
Push again

git push heroku master:main
Solve!
```
## set up db on heroku

start commands with

heroku run

migrate the database

heroku run rails db:migrate
